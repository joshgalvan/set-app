# set-ios-app

This is my first iOS app and it recreates the game of Set, with rules described [here](https://smart-games.org/en/main/rules/), and play mimicking [here](https://smart-games.org/en/set/submit_set).

This is a solo version of Set, and could use some more info displayed to the user to better play the game, but this project was mainly developed to help me initially practice iOS development with SwiftUI and I didn't plan on spending too much time on it.

This app lacks any animation, but I will be using animation in other apps. This app was developed as part of homework 4 of Standford's CS193P "Developing Apps for iOS" [course](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/).

A demo of this project is shown [here](https://streamable.com/b3z2j0) on Streamable.

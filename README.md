# set-ios-app

This is my first iOS app, and it recreates the game of Set, with rules described [here](https://smart-games.org/en/main/rules/), and play mimicking [here](https://smart-games.org/en/set/submit_set).

This is a solo version of Set, and could use some more info displayed to the user to better play the game, but this project was mainly developed to help me practice iOS development with SwiftUI and didn't plan on spending too much time on it.

A demo of this project is shown [here](https://streamable.com/b3z2j0) on Streamable.
